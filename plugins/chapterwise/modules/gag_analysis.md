- Use markdown formatting: ## Headers, **bold**, *italic*, - lists
- Quote specific jokes or humorous passages when analyzing
- Recognize that absence of humor is not a flaw in non-comedic works
- Consider whether humor serves the narrative or disrupts tone
- Identify both successful and unsuccessful comedic attempts
- Note cultural or contextual factors that affect humor
- Color rating: #10b981 (green) for effective comedy, #f59e0b (amber) for mixed, #ef4444 (red) for ineffective
- Distinguish between intentional and unintentional humor
- Consider the target audience when assessing humor appropriateness
